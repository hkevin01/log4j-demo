# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for stable releases
- Use feature branches for new features
- Use pull requests for code review

## CI/CD Pipelines
- GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy
- Automated testing on each push and pull request

## Code Review
- All changes require review before merging
- Use comments and suggestions for improvements
